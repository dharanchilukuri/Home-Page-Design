          In earlier chapters, we’ve dealt mostly with functional React
          components that do not require state management. This chapter’s main
          focus is on state, its management and components that utilise it in
          React.

        <h3>What is State?</h3>
        <p>
          State is a
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object"
            target="_blank"
            >JavaScript object</a
          >
          that stores a component’s dynamic data and determines the component’s
          behaviour. Because state is dynamic, it enables a component to keep
          track of changing information in between renders and for it to be
          dynamic and interactive. State is similar to props but unlike props,
          it is private to a component and is controlled solely by the said
          component. In the examples from previous chapters, the behaviour of
          components has primarily depended on the props that are passed down to
          them. In those cases, the components that receive the props have no
          control over them because props are read-only.

        <p>Adding State to a Class Component</p>

        <span class="class-name">class</span> Greeting extends React.Component {
          <span class="function">render()</span>{
            return &lt;h1&gt;I’m a component in need of some state! &lt;/h1&gt;;

          Adding state to the <strong>Greeting</strong> component above involves
          defining within the class component, a constructor function that
          assigns the initial state using this.state.

        <h3>Investigating State using React Dev Tools</h3>
        <p>
          The devtools are available for download on both Mozilla Firefox
          Add-ons and the Chrome Web Store. Follow the appropriate link to
          install the devtools depending on which browser you have installed on
          your computer. Throughout the rest of this book, Chrome will be used
          as the browser of choice. In order to confirm successful installation
          of the devtools on Chrome, open the developer tools window using
          <strong>Cmd+Opt+I</strong> on a Mac or <strong>+Alt+I</strong> on a
          windows PC. You should now see a <code>React</code> tab.
